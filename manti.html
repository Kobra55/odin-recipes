<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a recipe of Manti, a traditional dish from turkey, my home country.</p>
<p>It is traditionally served with joghurt and a tomato butter sauce.</p>
<p>Actually it is a very simple dish, all you need is a little time. Because you have to prepare the dough and let it rest at least an hour or two. Afte that is done you need to form little balls and open them up so you can fill it with the ground beef mixtutre. After all that you must throw them in boiling water with a bit of salt and let them boil at least ten minutes. After that you can start preparing the tomato-butter sauce, all you need to do is to add butter in a pan as much you prefer and ad tomato paste to it and let it cook for a bit until its a mass. </p>
