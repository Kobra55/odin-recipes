   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <p><strong>For the yeast dough</strong></p>
    <li>500 g wheat flour</li>
    <li>300 ml water</li>
    <li>2 Tsp salt</li>
    <li>5 g of fresh yeast</li>
    <p><strong>For the sauce</strong></p>
    <li>1 can of Pizza tomatos</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>a little bit of sugar</li>
    <li>oregano</li>
    <li>basil</li>
   </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><em><strong>Preperation ot the dough</strong></em></p>
        <li>First sift the flour with the salt and pour it into a dough mixer or a bread maker with a dough function. Now dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and then add it to the flour-salt mixture</li>
        <p>
            Then knead the ingredients into an elastic, homogeneous dough for 20 minutes.
            Note: An electric aid is almost mandatory here; if necessary, a hand mixer with a dough hook will also work. 
            Please don't knead desperately with your bare hand, the dough simply won't achieve the desired softness and consistency.</p>
        <p>After kneading, cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for two hours. Then divide into four pieces of 200 g each, 
           form them into balls and cover again and let rise for another six hours.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Preperation of the sauce</strong></em></p>
        <li>For the tomato sauce, simply puree a can of peeled tomatoes with (lots of) garlic, salt, pepper
            , a little sugar, basil and oregano, do not boil.</li>
        <p><em><strong>Preparing the Pizza</strong></em></p>
        <li>Then apply the tomato sauce to the middle of the pizza and spread it over the entire pizza in circular movements with the trowel. Don't apply too much! A good pizza shouldn't be drowned in tomato sauce. 
            If individual areas of the dough don't get any sauce, it doesn't matter at all. Better a little less than a little more.</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to maximum! Place the dough on the hot baking tray (this is easier with baking paper) and after just 3 - 4 minutes the pizza is ready and can be enjoyed.</p>
